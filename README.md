# 👋 Hi there, I'm @TechTyphoon

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- AI & ML Projects (especially those involving vision and LLMs)
- Cybersecurity, CTFs, and Ethical Hacking
- Full-stack Web Development (MERN, event platforms, data dashboards)
- DevOps and containerization using Docker
- Embedded Systems & VLSI (STM32, sensors, microcontrollers)
- Automation tools like n8n, GitHub Actions, and open-source agents
- Building real-world, gamified, and story-driven learning tools

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- DevOps (via gamified projects and character-based learning)
- Cybersecurity fundamentals, rooting Android, and ethical hacking
- Advanced Git, CI/CD, and local hosting of automation systems
- Solidity and Blockchain basics
- DSA for ECE applications and core concepts from my syllabus (19ECE261, VLSI, Control Systems)

## 💻 Internships & Projects:
- ✈️ **Flight Motion Data Visualizer** – Web-based offline dashboard using Docker to visualize real-time flight data at HAL Bangalore
- 🧠 **Construction Progress Detection using DL** – Predicts floors and construction % from site images
- 🌿 **Plant Disease Detection** – Ran ML model with image inputs using Python and streamlit
- 🧪 **Event Booking Platform** – Full-stack system inspired by Eventbrite with advanced features (auth, ical, ticketing, etc.)

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Innovative AI projects using Google AI Studio or Gemini
- Offline-first dashboards for institutions and industries
- Cybersecurity awareness tools, beginner-friendly CTFs
- Dockerized platforms that run locally with zero internet dependency
- LLM-powered productivity tools and GitHub agent bots
